            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I grew up in a small-ish town in Alaska. Growing up I was a competitive gymnast and cheerleader. Now I live in Boise and go to Boise State University where I study Computer Science and GIMM. I enjoying coding a lot. I know many languages including but not limited to Java, C, SWIFT, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
            I started in the GIMM program my second semester at Boise State. I wanted to add GIMM becuase I wanted to be able todo more interactive coding then I would be doing if I only did computer science. When I am done with school I want to do softwear development for an aerospace company. Outside of school I love to be outside and go hiking. 
            I also snowbaord a lot desipite the fact I am horrible at it. Along with that i coach gymnastics and cheerleading. I currently coach in Boise but during the summers I coach at a large world known extreme sports camp called Woodward in PA.
