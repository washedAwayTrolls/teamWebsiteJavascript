GIMM 300 team project 3

Team Website: Javascript and Bootstrap
Importance:
Many of the web apps and websites developed in industry and the private sector are group efforts (and almost all tech companies operate in scrum or agile groups), accordingly it is vital you learn to communicate and work effectively with other developers, artists/designers, testers, and project managers.  I will ask you to try each of these roles even if it is not your preferred role in a group project so that you have enough empathy, understanding, and experience in this role to work effectively with others that take that role on for group work.  
 
There are four roles, one for each group member (if your group has more or less than four contact me and we’ll work something out where a member or a role doubles up).  These are project lead, digital artist/web designer, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer.  Please note that for the first three team projects you will all be doing a certain amount of coding to get familiar with and practice with html, css, and javascript foundations.  For all projects, you must indicate who has what role and stick with those roles for this project, then switch for the next website project so that everyone gets a chance in every role.  This should be well documented and easy for me to look over and understand who was doing what and what they contributed in the website design doc that you will submit with your group game, and you should indicate who is switching to what role for the next group project in a clear way.
Explanation: 
 
This assignment asks you to make 4 new pages with your group and add the bootstrap framework to significant portions of your entire team website (all links) so that you practice responsive design web development (mobile first dev).  Additionally to these changes to html and css, you will design, develop, and test the four new pages (2 javascript pages, 2 html pages) and coordinate through your current group leader. 
 
Add bootstrap (via cdn preferably) to your entire group website
Fix the inevitable design issues that will come up when you switch to new css classes from your custom classes
Use the bootstrap nav bar and footer consistently on all team website pages.
Use the javascript script tag to change an html element or a css attribute of three elements in an html page.  Document where this occurs on your website in the WDD.
Using a separate javascript file that you link to in an html file called random.js and random.html, do the following:
First, set up a button that when clicked changes an html element
Then set up a separate button that when clicked changes a css property
Next set up a text box and third button that provides some kind of feedback to the user when they enter in text and click a submit button.
Now use a randomization javascript function to set up a random number generator that takes a number range that a user enters and gives back a random number when they click a button (for example, if I enter 1 and I00 as the range, I should get a random number from 1 to 100 back in a way that is visible to me from a browser).  Indicate where a-d occur in your WDD.
Now use the same randomization logic to do something creative (like add elements to the page, trigger audio/visual feedback, etc) in a way that depends on the random number returned (adding 40 divs with unique and interesting css properties to the page when the user enters a number range between 0 and 100 and the number generator returns 40 for example would satisfy this requirement, but try to be creative here and do something fun like make 40 stars appear or 40 balloons fly up).  
Now on a new page called game.html, create and link to a javascript file called game.js that contains a simple game that uses a similar kind of random number generator but has an interesting core game loop to play (for example card games like war and blackjack, dice rolling games, number guessing games, etc. would all satisfy this requirement).  
Update your index.html landing page to have links to these new pages.
 
Most of your grade will be determined by carefully documenting your group’s cooperative dynamics and the responsibility for this falls primarily on the project lead although other group members should help, so bear this in mind as you set up and manage the trello board and the group WDD (web design document) where you will write up your groups collective contributions following this template: GIMM 300 Website Design Doc Template

When you finish your team website, post your experience as a team and a link to the website on the group discussion board thread in blackboard group discussion called team websites and apps and have each individual member make constructive and helpful comments on three different other team websites.  As the template indicates, include documentation of each member’s comments (12 total comments/screenshots, all on different websites) in your WDD.  It is important we all learn as a community and I want you to have the opportunity to show your work, help others, and be helped by others in the class, so it is vital for the class that you do this last step.
Rubrix/Assessment:
Here’s what I’ll look at to determine your grade on this group project (500pts max)
 
A detailed account up of the contributions of all group members in the WBB according to the template here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyvn4u8bsJc4cOVGQuDq5G53lTqmLa8VHecsVkxF83Q/edit?usp=sharing (200 pts possible)
A write up of who will be the next project lead, artist, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer in the group (everyone must fill each role once).  (25 pts possible)
Screenshots and links for group coordination in github and trello (25pts possible)
Screenshots showing completion of every group member’s freecodecamp exercises (25 pts possible) 
Screenshots of all group members comments on other teams’ website posts to blackboard discussion, with each member commenting on different websites.  In other words, 12 different total other group websites should be commented on if possible - 3 per group member.  Group also must UPDATE the same original post with an explanation of the changes they made and a publicly accessible link to their website landing page (index.html) for others to comment on.  (25  pts possible)
Project requirements outlined in 1-4 of the Explanation Section above are achieved with excellence (200 pts)
