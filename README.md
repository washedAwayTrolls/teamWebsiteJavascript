GIMM 300 team project 2


Team Website: CSS
Importance:
Many of the web apps and websites developed in industry and the private sector are group efforts (and almost all tech companies operate in scrum or agile groups), accordingly it is vital you learn to communicate and work effectively with other developers, digital artists/designers, testers, and project managers.  I will ask you to try each of these roles even if it is not your preferred role in a group project so that you have enough empathy, understanding, and experience in this role to work effectively with others that take that role on for group work.  
 
There are four roles, one for each group member (if your group has more or less than four contact me and we’ll work something out where a member or a role doubles up).  These are project lead, digital artist/web designer, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer.  Please note that for the first three team projects you will all be doing a certain amount of coding to get familiar with and practice with html, css, and javascript foundations.  For all projects, you must indicate who has what role and stick with those roles for this project, then switch for the next website project so that everyone gets a chance in every role.  This should be well documented and easy for me to look over and understand who was doing what and what they contributed in the website design doc that you will submit with your group game, and you should indicate who is switching to what role for the next group project in a clear way.
Explanation: 
 
To get familiar with css rules, specificity, and combining selectors, look through the css rules on W3 schools here https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp and create a web project that accomplishes the following:
 
Use inline styling and the <style> tag in a new html called document called style.html to change 5 html elements appearance in different ways.  Write an explanation for how the html and css makes this particular element appear the way it does that appears for a view of the webpage style.html (i.e. I should be able to read your explanations if I visit that page in a browser).  Link to this page in an artful way in your index.html file.
Using a separate .css file called style.css instead of inline styling or the style tag, have each group member change ten different style properties throughout all your webpages using CSS selectors (like h1, li, a, etc) for at least 5 different kinds of html tags that occur in throughout your team website (set this up so that every html page links to the same style.css page, don’t use inline styling or the <style> tag anywhere but in the style.html you did in the previous step).  Document these contributions in your WDD.
Have each team member create one custom class of CSS and two custom id’s with at least 3 property value pairs that target their webpage only in this style.css class (so if bob was the name of a group member, bob.html should link to style.css and in style.css there should one custom class and two custom id’s that bob writes which change only tags in bob.hml, not the rest of the team website).
At least 3 times, use combined declaration syntax for tag selectors with one class selector or one id selectors that target only the elements you wish to target in your html files.  For example 
#content h1 {  background-color: yellow;}
Would combine declaration of a tag (#content) with an element (h1).  You will need to do this with at least 3 classes and ids. In your WDD explain where this occurs.
Each group member should add at least one css animation which you can learn about here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp
And here:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/learn-how-the-css-keyframes-and-animation-properties-work
Animations should be added to the personal webpage.  All members must have different animations.
Finally, using what you now know about html and CSS, redesign, implement, and test as a group your landing page for your team website (index.html) in such a way that it looks like a professional company’s: “Our Team” or “Meet the Team” section of their website.  For some examples look here: https://digitalagencynetwork.com/top-inspiring-digital-agency-meet-the-team-page-examples/ 
or here: 
https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-agency-team-pages
Finally, have each individual group member add their own homepage content with at least a bio and picture, and link to and from that page with a consistent nav bar at the top of all team website pages.
 
Most of your grade will be determined by carefully documenting your group’s cooperative dynamics and the responsibility for this falls primarily on the project lead although other group members should help, so bear this in mind as you set up and manage the trello board and the group WDD (web design document) where you will write up your groups collective contributions following this template: GIMM 300 Website Design Doc Template

When you finish your team website, post your experience as a team and a link to the website on the group discussion board thread in blackboard group discussion called team websites and apps and have each individual member make constructive and helpful comments on three different other team websites.  As the template indicates, include documentation of each member’s comments (12 total comments/screenshots, all on different websites) in your WDD.  It is important we all learn as a community and I want you to have the opportunity to show your work, help others, and be helped by others in the class, so it is vital for the class that you do this last step.
 
Rubrix/Assessment:
Here’s what I’ll look at to determine your grade on this group project (500pts max)
 
A detailed account up of the contributions of all group members in the WBB according to the template here: GIMM 300 Website Design Doc Template (200pts possible)
Screenshots showing completion of every group member’s freecodecamp exercises (25 pts possible) 
Screenshots of all group members comments on other teams’ website posts to blackboard discussion, with each member commenting on different websites.  In other words, 12 total other group websites should be commented on if possible - 3 per group member.  Group also must UPDATE the same original post with an explanation of the changes they made and a publicly accessible link to their website landing page (index.html) for others to comment on.  (25  pts possible)
A write up of who will be the next project lead, artist, primary developer and secondary tester, and primary tester and secondary developer in the group (everyone must fill each role once).  (25 pts possible)
Screenshots and links for group coordination in github and trello (25pts possible)
Project requirements outlined in 1-7 of the Explanation Section above are achieved with excellence (175 pts possible)
